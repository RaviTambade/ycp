Abstraction is a concept that involves simplifying complex systems or ideas by focusing on the essential details and ignoring irrelevant ones. It allows you to create a general representation of something, which can be used in different contexts without dealing with the specifics.

In different fields, abstraction takes on slightly different meanings:

- **In computer science and programming**, abstraction refers to hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary parts. For example, when you use a function or method in code, you don't need to understand how it works internally; you only need to know what it does and how to use it.

- **In mathematics**, abstraction allows you to generalize concepts and work with higher-level structures that aren't tied to specific instances, like using variables instead of specific numbers in equations.

- **In art or philosophy**, abstraction refers to representing concepts, emotions, or objects in a non-literal way, focusing on the essence rather than detailed representation.

In essence, abstraction helps make things more manageable and understandable by removing unnecessary complexity.
