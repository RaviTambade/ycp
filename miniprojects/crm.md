### **Data Structures:**

1. **Customer Structure:**
   Each customer will be represented by a structure containing the following attributes:
   - Customer ID
   - Name
   - Address
   - Phone number
   - Email address
   - Interaction history (could be another structure or linked list to store multiple interactions)

   ```c
   #define MAX_CUSTOMERS 100

   // Structure to store customer information
   struct Customer {
       int customerID;         // Unique identifier for each customer
       char name[100];         // Customer's full name
       char address[200];      // Customer's address
       char phone[15];         // Customer's phone number
       char email[100];        // Customer's email address
       char interactionHistory[500]; // Description of interactions with the customer
   };

   struct Customer customers[MAX_CUSTOMERS];
   int totalCustomers = 0;  // Total number of customers
   ```

2. **Interaction Structure:**
   Each interaction with a customer will be recorded, including the type of interaction (phone call, email, etc.) and the details of the interaction.

   ```c
   struct Interaction {
       char interactionType[50];  // Type of interaction (Phone, Email, etc.)
       char interactionDetails[500]; // Description of the interaction
       char date[20];             // Date of interaction
   };
   ```

### **Functional Requirements:**

1. **Add Customer:**
   - The system should allow the user to enter customer details, including name, address, phone number, and email. Each customer will be assigned a unique customer ID.

2. **View Customer Information:**
   - The system should allow the user to view a list of all customers or search for customers by name or customer ID.

3. **Update Customer Information:**
   - The system should allow updating a customer’s details such as name, address, phone, or email address.

4. **Delete Customer:**
   - The system should allow deleting a customer’s record from the database by their unique customer ID.

5. **Record Customer Interactions:**
   - For each customer, the system should allow recording multiple interactions, such as phone calls, emails, or meetings. Each interaction will include details about the interaction, the type (phone call, email, meeting, etc.), and the date.

6. **Generate Reports:**
   - The system should allow generating reports of all customers, displaying their details and interaction histories. The report could be filtered by customer type (e.g., all customers who interacted in the last week).

7. **Search Customers:**
   - The system should allow searching for customers based on customer ID, name, or phone number.

```

---

### **Constraints and Assumptions:**

1. **Fixed Capacity:**
   - The system will be limited to a maximum of `MAX_CUSTOMERS` (e.g., 100). If the number of customers exceeds this limit, no new customers can be added.

2. **Basic Input Validation:**
   - The system will perform basic validation to ensure that customer information (such as phone numbers and email addresses) is entered correctly.

3. **No Persistent Data Storage:**
   - The system will not save data to external files or a database. All data will be stored in memory during the session, and the data will be lost when the program ends. This feature can be extended in the future to allow file-based storage or integration with databases.

4. **Simple User Interface:**
   - The system will use a **text-based user interface** to interact with the user. The interface will provide options to the user for performing operations such as adding, updating, and deleting customer records.

 
 
### **Conclusion:**

The **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System** designed in C helps businesses manage customer interactions, store customer information, and track communication history. The system provides essential features such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting customer records, as well as recording and viewing interactions with customers. Future enhancements can include integrating file storage or a database for persistent data, advanced search and reporting capabilities, and a more user-friendly interface.
