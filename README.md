# Learning C++
C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s as an extension of the C language, with added features like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. 

It's widely used for developing software such as game engines, operating systems, embedded systems, and high-performance applications. Learning C++ involves understanding its syntax, data types, control structures, and advanced concepts like pointers, references, and templates.
