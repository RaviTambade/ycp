Software , Hardware
Firmware
System Softwarwe: Operating System
Examples of OS: Unix, Windows, Linux, Mac Os,  Android
Unix commands are compiled C cosole Applications
	Linux commands :ls, mkdir, cd, sudo , getch, whoami, pwd
	Liunx shell
C Programming used for Systems programming
		   for building your embedded systems
		   for building your firmwawre
		   for building device drivers
	           for building Operating systems
		   for building application softwares (desktop, distributed)
		   for building Tools ( compilers ,linkers, parser,
					loaders, debuggers,etc.)
		   for building IDE ( Visual studio, Eclipse, etc.)


C Programming Culture
	 any text editor to write C  program
	 source of C  is written in text file with extenion .c
	 each C program should contain entry point function main
	 C program may contain inbuilt functions such printf, scanf,etc.
	 inbuilt functions are defined in header files such as stdio.h
         Header files are included into C source code  using preprocessor #include
	 Constant can be defined using macros  #define PI 3.14
	 data is kept into variable  int count=56;
	 varaibles  could be global or local 
	 variables are initialized with values.
